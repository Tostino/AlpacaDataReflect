# Alpaca Reflect
Alpaca Reflect is a Python script that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to improve and correct answers to a set of questions or commands. It reads input data from a JSON file, processes it, and writes the reflection and corrected answers to another JSON file.
## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- OpenAI Python library

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:


```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/alpaca_reflect.git
```
2. Install the required library:
```
pip install openai
```
3. Set up an OpenAI API key:
- Get an API key from <a href="https://beta.openai.com/signup/" target="_new">OpenAI</a>
- Export the API key as an environment variable:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here"
```

## Usage
1. Prepare your input data in a JSON file named `alpaca_data_cleaned.json`. The data should be an array of objects, each containing an `instruction`, an `input`, and an `output`:


```
[
{
"instruction": "Name one example of a non-human primate",
"input": "A primate that is not a human.",
"output": "Chimpanzee"
},
...
]
```
2. Run the script:</li></ol>
```
python alpaca_reflect.py
```
3. The script will process each question/command and save the reflection and corrected answers to a file named `alpaca_reflect.json`:</li></ol>
```
[
    {
    "instruction": "Name one example of a non-human primate",
    "input": "A primate that is not a human.",
    "output": "Chimpanzee",
    "reflection": " The given answer is a valid example of a non-human primate.",
    "corrected": " N/A"
    },
    ...
]
```
## Limitations
- The script requires a valid OpenAI API key with access to the GPT-3.5-turbo model.
- The script processes the input data sequentially, so it may take a significant amount of time if the input data is large.
